# WE!ARE!!MAKING!!!A!!!!GAME!!!!! 👾🕹


Right now, we are not exactly sure how we want to build it but [@jordanenichols](https://github.com/jordanenichols/) made some great progress in SDL2.

Upon further consideration, we are considering making it in Rust. Not sure which engine we want to use though 🤷...


Check back soon for updates 👍
